# README

In this project, we have applied many filters that helped us understand image processing in depth by utilizing OpenCV functions and manually adjusting pixel values to know the work behind these techniques. This project helped us gain more familiarity with OpenCV, its datatypes, and its libraries, and learn how to use these functionalities in the C++ platform.

**List of commands:**

1. Press 'q' to exit the program.
2. Press 's' to save the current frame as "captured_frame.png".

5. Press 'h' to convert the image to custom grayscale.
6. Press 't' to convert the image to custom sepia.
7. Press 'b' to convert the image to custom blur.
8. Press 'B' to convert the image to a custom (faster) blur.
9. Press 'x' to convert the image using the SobelX filter.
10. Press 'y' to convert the image using the SobelY filter.
11. Press 'l' to apply blur and quantize the image.
12. Press 'm' to generate a gradient magnitude image.
13. Press 'f' to use face detection.
14. Press 'c' to make the face colorful.
15. Press ‘a’ to blur the background outside of the face. 
16. Press 'n' to make a negative image.
