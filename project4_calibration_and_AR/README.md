In this project, we successfully accomplished the goal of calibrating a camera and implementing augmented reality functionalities. Using a chessboard pattern, we detected and extracted target corners, allowing us to accurately calibrate the camera and calculate its pose in real time. By projecting 3D points onto the image plane and creating virtual objects, we demonstrated the seamless integration of virtual elements into the real-world scene. Our system achieved robust feature detection and accurate projection of virtual objects relative to the target. By exploring different ways in which we transformed our target piece into something else, changing colors of the object as we change the position of the camera, using multiple targets simuntaneousfly, we had fun in this project. This project provided valuable insights into computer vision techniques, camera calibration, and augmented reality applications, enhancing our understanding of these concepts and their practical implementations.
